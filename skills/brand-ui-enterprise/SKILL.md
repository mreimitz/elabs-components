# brand-ui-enterprise

Design **enterprise-grade applications** with brand-ui. This skill is the _judgment_
layer: decide what kind of product you're building, pick the right shell, stand up the
mandatory baseline, then build screens from `@elabs-ai/components-*` with enterprise UX discipline.
Keep this file lean — load a `reference/` file when its step is active.

## What this skill owns — and defers

- **Owns:** the professional / consumer / marketing call + register; the shell-archetype
  choice; the enterprise **app baseline** (definition of done); applying enterprise UX
  principles mapped to `@elabs-ai/components-*`.
- **Defers:** real component props/APIs → the **`brand-ui`** skill (`brand-ui search` /
  `brand-ui docs`); scored UX/a11y review → **`brand-ui-audit`** (set its register =
  _product/professional_); a brand-new scaffold interview → **`brand-ui-new-app`** (feed it
  the shell archetype this skill picked — **A** tool/workspace or **B** enterprise admin);
  tokens/themes → **`brand-ui-theme`**.
- **Never:** re-implement a component, invent props, or use marketing patterns in a
  professional surface.

## Procedure (in order)

### 0 · Detect the mode (what situation am I in?)

Infer from the request + the workspace — don't interrogate:

- **Create** (greenfield) · **Extend** (add to a brand-ui app) · **Audit & fix** (review /
  remediate an existing app) · **Retrofit** (bring a non-brand-ui app onto brand-ui).

Look first (`package.json` for `@elabs-ai/components-*`, an existing shell/routes); ask one question
only if genuinely ambiguous. Each mode has its own short question set + hand-offs.
→ `reference/modes-and-interaction.md`.

### 1 · Classify the surface → state the register

Decide first: **professional / consumer / marketing?**

- Professional — "a trained user does this repeatedly as their job" → **calm** register.
- Consumer — "a stranger uses this voluntarily; we want them back" → **lighter** register.
- Marketing — "a visitor is deciding whether to care; one action" → **expressive** register.

Say the answer out loud before building. Mixed product → classify **per surface** (the
app shell is professional; a `/landing` or `/pricing` route is marketing).
→ `reference/professional-vs-marketing.md` (tests, table, the trap, legitimate exceptions).

### 2 · Pick the shell archetype + plan the nav

Professional apps use one of two shells — choose up front (hard to change later):

- **A — tool/workspace** (editor / inspector / canvas): inset collapsible sidebar +
  routed content + status bar + navigator/inspector panes + ⌘K palette.
- **B — enterprise admin** (console): icon sidebar (top-level views) + topnav +
  breadcrumb + optional secondary rail + detail.

Marketing → no sidebar; top nav + single scroll.
→ `reference/shell-and-navigation.md` (archetypes, nav-type catalog, canonical snippets).

### 3 · Stand up the baseline (mandatory, by default)

Every professional app gets these **without being asked**: the chosen shell, the
**collapsible brand app icon + favicon**, **ThemeProvider + System/Light/Dark
switcher**, a **settings modal**, the **Sonner `Toaster`**, and a **right-side detail
panel** (generic `Sheet`/`Drawer`; `@elabs-ai/components-ai` `ContextPanel` for AI surfaces).
→ `reference/enterprise-app-baseline.md` (spec, root wiring, definition-of-done checklist).

### 4 · Model the objects & task flow, then build screens

**Model first, lay out second** (noun → verb): list the **objects** (Country, Customer,
Order), their **relationships**, **actions** and **attributes**; give each object a
**detail hub** (header + attributes + actions + related lists) and connect them with
**drill-down/up navigation** (breadcrumb path, peer prev/next, preserved list position).
Pick the **detail/task surface** by context + complexity + reference-need: full page (hub /
multi-step) · drawer/`Sheet` (keep the list in view) · modal `Dialog`/`AlertDialog`
(focused / irreversible) · inline/expand (repeated edits). **Never dump everything onto one
page.** → `reference/object-and-navigation-patterns.md`.

Then **prioritize by information value**: rank each region (act › decide › reference › raw),
match space + emphasis + interaction to importance, turn findings into actions, kill redundancy,
order sections summary-first, and promote a high-value task to its own surface.
→ `reference/information-priority-and-emphasis.md`.

**Before composing any single net-new screen**, run the design-first ritual below
("Designing a net-new screen") — intent sentence, references, distinct concepts, a
mocked concept, then the full state grid. Skipping straight to component assembly is
exactly the function-first "list + card" failure this skill exists to prevent.

Then compose from `@elabs-ai/components-*` with enterprise discipline: density-with-progressive-disclosure,
every state designed, calm token-only visuals, motion that explains state, fix-oriented
copy. Real props: default to `brand-ui docs`/`brand-ui search`, or compose with documented props
and **flag** what's unconfirmed — never guess. Deep-verifying against the vendored `@elabs-ai/components-*`
source is **optional** (shipping-critical only), not an every-run step. → `reference/principles.md`.

### 5 · Verify → hand off

Run the baseline checklist (`enterprise-app-baseline.md` §3). Route a scored review to
**`brand-ui-audit`** with register = _product/professional_ (so it judges this as a
professional product surface, not marketing). For a greenfield scaffold, hand
**`brand-ui-new-app`** the shell archetype this skill picked (**A** tool/workspace or **B**
enterprise admin) so it starts from the right shell. Report honestly what you did **not**
visually verify (compiled ≠ looked at). → `reference/modes-and-interaction.md` (per-mode hand-offs).

## Designing a net-new screen (run before scaffolding it)

Step 4's object model tells you WHAT screens exist; this is the ritual for HOW each one
gets designed, not just assembled. Before writing app code for any net-new screen, page,
or major surface:

1. **Intent, in one sentence.** Who opens it, what do they leave with? Not "a directory
   of X" — "tells ops which orders need action today".
2. **2–3 named references**, looked up proactively (comparable products/screens), and
   what they do that this one should match or beat.
3. **2–3 conceptually distinct concepts**, not parameters of one composition — score
   against the intent, recommend one.
4. **Mock the recommended concept as a story** before it becomes a real route/page.
5. **Design the full state grid with the happy path**: Ready · Loading (`Skeleton`) ·
   Empty (`StatePanel`/`EmptyState`) · Error (`StatePanel`/`ErrorState`, terminal only) ·
   First-run — never retrofitted.
6. **The non-component layers**: illustration (does this moment deserve one?), motion
   (what state change must be felt?), voice/microcopy (fix-oriented, specific), and
   information hierarchy (what reads first — is that right?).
7. **Close with a review**, not a compile — route to `brand-ui-audit` before calling it
   shipped.

Component lists and prop budgets are the LAST step, never the first. Full checklist:
`reference/screen-design-brief.md`.

## Critical rules (always)

- **Classification-first.** Never build before stating surface type + register.
- **Objects and tasks before pages.** Model the objects (noun → verb), give each a detail
  hub, connect them with drill-down/up navigation. A screen operates on an object or
  completes a task — it is **never** a content-dump of everything on one page.
- **Right component for each structural job.** Sticky `PageShell`/`SectionHeader` header with
  a `ButtonGroup` toolbar (not loose buttons); `Tabs` for an object's sections (not a card
  stack); `SplitPanel` master-detail when a list drives a detail (never detail **below** the
  list); a searchable list with a count (not hand-rolled cards). → `screen-layout-patterns.md`.
- **Importance drives emphasis, space & interaction.** Rank every region by value to the task
  (act › decide › reference › raw); give the most valuable content the most space, prominence,
  and interaction; de-emphasize or hide reference/raw; kill redundancy (say each thing once);
  order sections summary-first; promote a high-value repeated task (e.g. Run X) to its own
  surface. → `information-priority-and-emphasis.md`.
- **The baseline is mandatory** for professional apps — not opt-in.
- **Professional register discipline:** dense-by-design + progressive disclosure; calm,
  token-only visuals; motion explains state (<~200 ms, `motion-reduce` safe).
- **No marketing slop in a pro surface:** no hero/landing layout, no wall of three equal
  feature cards, no gradient/"AI-purple" accents, no fake-perfect stats, no
  "Acme / Jane Doe" content, no filler verbs (elevate, seamless, unleash…).
- **Semantic tokens only**; must read in light **and** dark. Real elements,
  visible focus, labels, `aria-label` on icon-only controls.
- **Compose, don't reinvent.** Defer APIs to `brand-ui`; defer scoring to `brand-ui-audit`.
- **Lean by default.** Load only the active step's `reference/*.md`, not all of them; deep
  prop-verification against the vendored `@elabs-ai/components-*` source is **opt-in** (shipping-critical only) —
  the default is `brand-ui docs` or compose-and-flag. Don't turn every run into a full audit.

## The category error this skill prevents

"Build an internal admin console for X" must **not** produce a marketing landing (hero
banner, three equal cards, big gradient headline, fake stats). An admin console is a
**professional** surface → archetype B + the baseline. Reaching for `@elabs-ai/components-marketing`
in an operational app? Stop and re-do step 1.
