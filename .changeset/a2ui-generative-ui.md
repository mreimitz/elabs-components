A2UI — the generative-UI path — ships. `@elabs-ai/components-ai` gains `<A2uiSurface>`: an agent describes a screen as JSON (`{ "a2ui": "1", "root": node }` of catalog types), the surface validates it against the catalog and renders it with the real components; `on.<event>` bindings reach the host's `onAction`, streaming prefixes build up node by node, and a settled invalid surface reports every problem with its path. The shipped catalog (`uiCatalog`, 62 ui types + `Stack`/`Grid`) is generated from the manifest; apps extend it with `createA2uiCatalog`/`defineA2uiType`. `@elabs-ai/components-charts` exports its half (`CHARTS_A2UI_BINDINGS`, `CHARTS_A2UI_CATALOG_SCHEMA`: `AutoChart`, `ChartCard`, `MetricGrid`, `Sparkline`, `BulletChart`, `Gauge`). The CLI adds `brand-ui a2ui catalog | schema | validate | example`, the MCP server the `a2ui` tool, and the JSON Schema is published as `@elabs-ai/components-ai/a2ui/schema.json`. `CardHeader` now lays a `CardAction` out top-right (it rendered below the description before).
